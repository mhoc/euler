# MoveZeroesLeft

Given an array of random integers, that has some number of integers `=== 0` such as

```
[ 5, 4, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0 ] 
```

sort the array such that the zeroes are all moved to the left side of the array. Beyond those zeroes, the sorting does not matter.

The output for the above array should be

```
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, ...other items ]
```
